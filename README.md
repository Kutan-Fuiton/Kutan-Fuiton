# 👋 Hi, I’m **Subarno Chakraborty** 

🧠 **Currently focused on _AI & Machine Learning_** as my primary career path, gaining hands-on experience in **Machine Learning** by working with **data**, experimenting with **models**, and exploring practical **ML algorithms**.

📈 **Strongly committed to improving _Data Structures & Algorithms_**, consistently pushing **problem-solving skills** as a long-term investment in writing better, more reliable code.

🌐 **My development journey began with web development**, where I explored both **frontend** and **backend** concepts, later applying backend knowledge while supporting some of my **ML projects**.

🔌 **Interested in the software side of IoT**, with a curiosity toward building **intelligent, data-driven systems** that connect software with real-world devices.

🌱 **I’ve faced failure across many projects, yet I continue to stay curious**, steadily growing through **hands-on software building** and learning from what didn’t work.
